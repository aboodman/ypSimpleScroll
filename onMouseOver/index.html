				<p>this here is a bunch of content.</p>
				<p>the reason i've taken the time to write actual content is because <a href="http://www.jesterworld.net/" target="_blank">brandon</a> bitched that there wasn't any.</p>
				<p>before it was just fake content in here. actually, it was the word "content" repeated over and over.</p>
				<p>i guess he's got a point, tho. on some OS's it was hard to tell anything was happening when it was the same word over and over.</p>
				<p>speaking of different OS's, mac and win9x users will be happy to note that ypSimpleScroll uses the same nifty frame-dropping animation algorithm that most other yp-components use. this means that all users, regardless of their platform or processor speed, will see the scroll box move at the same speed.</p>
				<p>"smoothness" is definately compromised on some crappy systems (mac netscape, win95), but atleast the user won't be sitting around for an hour waiting for the damned thing to scroll...</p>
